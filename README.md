# GUI-Database-Project

This project uses GUIs that allow the user to connect to a database and run SQL commands. The results are then displayed in the GUI.

In the java, properties files are used to validate log-in credentials. 

MYSQL was used as the SQL database. An SQL connector and SceneBuilder were used to build, test, and run.

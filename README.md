# GUI-Database-Project

This project uses GUIs that allow the user to connect to a database and run SQL commands. The results are then displayed in the GUI.

In the java, properties files are used to validate log-in credentials. 

MYSQL was used as the SQL database. An SQL connector and SceneBuilder were used to build, test, and run. 

Two GUIs are created: the client application and the accountant application. 

The client application allows for users to run select and update statements on the database.
There are two databases that are able to be connected to: the project 3 database and the bike database. 

The accountant application allows for users to run select statements on the database.
